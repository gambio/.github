## Welcome to the Gambio Community!

We are a team of innovative and dynamic people who work together towards one goal: supporting businesses and individuals in achieving success in e-commerce. Our mission is to provide flexible and user-friendly shop software that adapts to your needs.

## About Us

We are Gambio, a company with a long history of experience in developing e-commerce solutions. Our story began in 2000 when we first developed our own shop software. Since then, we've been continuously innovating and improving to support our customers.

* We strive for quality and reliability in our products.
* We offer flexible and adaptable shop software that meets your individual needs.

### Our Origin

Our roots lie in the Hanseatic and North German regions. We started as a small startup in Oldenburg, where we first realized shops and welcomed our first employees to the team. We've continued to grow, but remain true to our North German heritage. From here, we've accompanied thousands of traders in realizing their dreams.

### Sustainability & Climate Protection

Regardless of who you are, climate change affects us all. Our cloud hosting allows for flexible server scaling, and an efficient control system reduces power consumption. To further improve our CO2 balance, our data centers rely on a significant portion of hydroelectric energy. We strive to be as resource-efficient as possible, which is why we've submitted ourselves to independent certification and successfully obtained climate neutrality.

## Our Services

* Development of e-commerce solutions for small and medium-sized businesses
* User-friendly shop software with many features and modules
* Flexible and adaptable solution for your individual needs
* Professional support team to assist with questions and issues

Our shop software for e-commerce operators. It offers a flexible and user-friendly platform to manage your online store.

### Who is the Self-Hosting of the Gambio Shop Solution suitable for?

If you host our Gambio shop solution yourself, you'll receive the full functionality of the shop solution. From then on, you're responsible for hosting, maintenance, and updating. You'll benefit from greater flexibility and customizability compared to our cloud solutions. Whether it's developing necessary features or creating specific interfaces.

## How Can I Help?

We're looking for enthusiastic developers, designers, and marketing experts who want to contribute to our mission. If you're interested in joining our community or supporting us with a specific project, please get in touch!
